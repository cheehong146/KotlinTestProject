-Wanted too add users, comments, etc tab but then it wasn't in the scope as i realized halfway through, hence the pagerAdapter

improvement that could be made:
-build a scalable API request, client, resource class instead of hardcoding the url in the controller
-use activity instead of fragment/viewpager since there's only 1 screen
